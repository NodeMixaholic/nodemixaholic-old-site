<h1>Dear Chromebook haters:</h1>
<p>You say that Chromebooks are slow, which is strange because my 5+ year old i5 laptop runs Chrome OS (Not ArnoldTheBat, Cloudready, or FydeOS, actual Chrome OS via the Brunch Project) and it runs fine. The Chromebooks you have are probably crappy, 3+ year-old Chromebooks. TBH if this is you, stop commenting "oh chromebooks are so bad" because GUESS WHAT? Windows would be *more* bloated if you ran it on equal hardware. What's more, and I know this is a huge misconception is that you can't run .EXEs or Linux binaries. False again. You can run either Cross-over for Android OR Wine inside the Linux for Chrome OS VM. Oh yeah, there's a Linux VM in Chrome OS, didn't anyone tell ya? Also, people say you can't game/video edit. JUST USE STEAM/MINECRAFT FOR LINUX IN THE VM, IT RUNS FINE. AND AS FOR VIDEO EDITING, JUST USE KDENLIVE. Making music? LMMS for Linux. Photo editing? Either cloud app or GIMP.  MAKING A VIDEO GAME??? GODOT3. CODING IN .NET CORE? DOTNET AND VSCODE. Anything you can think of, you can do on ChromeOS. Also, quick note: There IS MS Office. Just go to the Play Store and get it.</p><br>
<p>I hope this cleared off as many misconceptions as it did for me letting off steam!</p><br>

<p><i>Same day, 9:53PM:</i> The reason yall might not have the Play Store or Linux is maybe because Chrome for Schools typically disables it. Also, schools typically get crappy Chromebooks to save a quick buck, thus why you probably have bad experiences. If you buy a Chromebook in 2021 for at least 250$, as long as it doesn't have a *crappy* Intel chip, it should be able to do most things fine. And yes, it can run ROBLOX, again, just get it from the Play Store.</p>
